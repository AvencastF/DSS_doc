# The Standard Model and Dark Photon

## The Standard Model
The Standard Model (SM) is the theoretical framework that describes the fundamental forces (excluding gravity) and particles in the known universe. It has successfully explained many phenomena observed in collider experiments. However, it is believed to be an effective field theory at low energies, indicating the need for more fundamental theories beyond the SM.

### Key Features of the Standard Model
- **Particles**: Quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, and the Higgs boson.
- **Forces**: Electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, mediated by photons, W/Z bosons, and gluons.
- **Limitations**: The SM does not explain dark matter, neutrino masses, or gravity.

## The Concept of Dark Photon
The dark photon, often denoted as A', is a hypothetical gauge boson that serves as a carrier for a new "dark force." This force may interact with dark matter, which is the primary motivation for its existence.

### Kinetic Mixing and the Dark Photon
The coupling between the dark photon and Standard Model particles occurs through kinetic mixing. The corresponding Lagrangian is:
```tex
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} + \frac{1}{2} \epsilon F^{\mu\nu} F'_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{4} F'_{\mu\nu} F'_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2} m_{A'}^2 A'^{\mu} A'_{\mu},
\end{equation}
```
where:
- <i><code-block lang="tex"> \epsilon </code-block></i> is the kinetic mixing parameter.
- <i><code-block lang="tex"> F^{\mu\nu} </code-block></i> and <i><code-block lang="tex"> F'_{\mu\nu} </code-block></i> are the field strength tensors for the photon and dark photon, respectively.
- <i><code-block lang="tex"> m_{A'} </code-block></i> is the dark photon mass.

The kinetic mixing parameter <i>&epsilon;</i>
governs the interaction strength between the dark photon and Standard Model particles. 

### Production Mechanisms of Dark Photon
Several processes can produce dark photons in experiments:
1. **Bremsstrahlung at Fixed-Target Experiments**: Involves electron or proton scattering with atomic nuclei.

2. **Annihilation at Lepton Colliders**: Results from electron-positron annihilation.
    - Feynman Diagram.
3. **Meson Decays**: Occurs when a meson (like <i><code-block lang="tex"> \pi^0 </code-block></i>) decays into a dark photon and a photon.

### Decay Modes of Dark Photon
The dark photon can decay into visible Standard Model particles or invisible dark sector final states, depending on its mass. If the dark photon mass is larger than twice the dark matter mass, it can decay into dark matter particles.

For invisible decay, the partial width of the dark photon is given by:
```tex
\Gamma(A' \rightarrow \chi \overline{\chi}) = \frac{1}{3} \alpha_D m_{A'} \sqrt{1 - \frac{4 m_{\chi}^2}{m_{A'}^2}} \left(1 + 2 \frac{m_{\chi}^2}{m_{A'}^2}\right),
```
where:
- <i><code-block lang="tex"> \alpha_D </code-block></i> is the dark sector fine structure constant.
- <i><code-block lang="tex"> m_{\chi} </code-block></i> is the dark matter mass.


For visible decay, the dark photon can decay into electron-positron pairs or muon pairs, among other visible final states.

## Relevance to the DarkSHINE Experiment
The DarkSHINE experiment is designed to search for dark photons through electron-on-target interactions. By observing missing momentum in the detector, the experiment aims to detect dark photons and gain insights into the nature of dark matter.

### Summary
The Standard Model has limitations in explaining dark matter, leading to the exploration of dark photons as a bridge between Standard Model particles and a new dark sector. Understanding the theoretical foundations and decay processes of dark photons is crucial for experiments like DarkSHINE, which aim to uncover the mysteries of dark matter and its interactions.
