# Discover DarkSHINE

## Introduction
The DarkSHINE experiment is a newly proposed **fixed-target experiment** at the _Shanghai High Repetition-Rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility_
(**SHINE**).
This experiment aims to search for **light dark matter**, with a focus on the study of dark photons,
which are strong candidates for dark force carriers and light dark matter in the sub-GeV mass range.

## Purpose
The primary goal of the DarkSHINE experiment is
to explore the physics potential of an electron-on-target setup to search for dark photons.
Dark photons can couple with photons through kinetic mixing and interact with Standard Model particles.
This interaction serves as a crucial portal between dark matter and ordinary matter.

## Experiment Design
- **Beam Parameters**: The SHINE facility provides a 10 MHz single electron beam with energy of 8 GeV.
- **Detector Setup**: The DarkSHINE detector consists of a silicon tracker system, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). The tracking system is placed inside a dipole magnet with a 1.5 T magnetic field.

## Signal and Background Simulations
- The experiment uses missing momentum to identify dark photons, which are expected to decay into dark matter candidates, leading to a loss of momentum.
- The study involves extensive signal and background simulations, with the aim of enhancing signal versus background separation.

## Sensitivity and Prospects
With <i><code-block lang="tex"> 3 \times 10^{14}</code-block></i> electron-on-target events,
this experiment aims to rule out most of the sensitive regions predicted by popular dark photon models. 
The study also explores the kinetic mixing parameter and the sensitivity for various dark photon mass ranges.
