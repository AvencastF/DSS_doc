# Installation Guide for DarkSHINE Software (DSS)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and setting up DarkSHINE Software (DSS) for the DarkSHINE experiment.

## Cloning the Repository

> Make sure you have access to IHEP GitLab.
> 
{style="note"}

DarkSHINE Software can be downloaded from GitLab. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@code.ihep.ac.cn:darkshine/darkshine-simulation.git
```

<tabs>
<tab title="Baseline %version% (latest)">
Using master branch as default, but always check the tags. 
</tab>
<tab title="Baseline 1.0">
If you need to run Baseline 1 samples, use this command to switch to the correct branch:

```bash
    git checkout tags/baseline1
```
</tab>
</tabs>



**Note**: The current version of configuration files for DSimu and DAna might not be compatible with previous releases. For more information, check the [Wiki page](https://code.ihep.ac.cn/darkshine/darkshine-simulation/-/wikis/Sample-Production).

## Check Dependencies

Before installing DSS, ensure you have the following dependencies on your machine:

- **C++17**
- **Geant4 10.06**
- **ROOT 6 (&#8805; 6.20)**
- **gsl**
- **yaml-cpp**
- **[nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)**

Alternatively, if you're using clusters with CVMFS installed, you can directly source the LCG environment with this command:

```shell
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_97rc4python3/x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt/setup.sh
```

## Build and Install DSS

With the necessary dependencies, you can build and install DSS:

```bash
cd darkshine-simulation   # Source directory
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your-install-directory> ../
# Use parallel build to speed up the process
make -j100  # not necessarily 100 ðŸ˜‡
make install
```

## Export Environment Variables

To ensure DSS runs properly, create a script to set up [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable). 
Here is an example of what `setup.sh` should contain:

```shell
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_97rc4python3/x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt/setup.sh
DSS_DIR=<your-install-directory>
export PATH=${DSS_DIR}/bin:${PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${DSS_DIR}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```

After creating the script, source it to apply the environment variables:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

## Final Check and Quick Guide on DSS

With everything set up, check your install directory to ensure everything is in place. 
Now youâ€™re ready to explore the software and start using it.

### Quick Guide on DSS

For example scripts, check the "scripts" folder in the corresponding source directories. 
This folder contains various examples to help you get started with DSS.
